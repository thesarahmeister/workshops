# Assignment: Plotting with ggplot2 #

**We will be using the `diamonds` dataframe included in `ggplot2` for all questions **

Try each of these challenges, going from raw data to final plot. Create a file
in the `practice` repo under `your-name/plotting` called `challenge.R`. The file
location should look like `your-name/plotting/challenge.R`. To get more practice
with Git, **add and commit** after completing each graph. Use the `diamonds`
dataset that comes with R.

1. Use the `qplot()` function to make a scatterplot with x=carat and y=price

2. Now color the plot by the cut. 

3. Change the above scatterplot to a histogram of carat, with the fill color of cut. 

4. Change the binwidth of the histogram to 1

** now to the `ggplot()` function **

5. Use the `ggplot()` function to make an object called `b` with x=color and y=depth. 

6. Make a boxplot out of `b`

7. Add the following titles:
    * Title: Depth and color of round cut diamonds
    * x label: Diamond color, from J(worst) to D(best)
    * y label: Depth (mm)
    
8. Create a `facet_wrap()` using the clarity attribute. Make 4 columns of facets (Hint: use `ncol`. Modifiy the title to say: Depth and color of round cut diamonds by clarity 

9. Make a correlation heatmap of all the numeric/integer columns of the 
diamonds dataset. Round the correlations to 3 digits. Use `%>%` piping (and the
`+` from `ggplot2`) to solve this problem. HINT: the cor function turns your
data into a matrix. Be sure to convert back into a dataframe.

10. (Combining what was learned last week) Create a point plot of the means of 
each numerical variable.  Have the variable on the y-axis and the means on the
x-axis. Make sure to properly label the axes and plot. As a bonus/option, make
the graph prettier.

11. Expand on challenge 10, but split the means up by `price` (hint: make a new 
factor variable from `price`) for dollars >2000 ('expensive') and <2000
('inexpensive').  The graph should have two dots for each variable on the y-axis
representing the means for each group of `price`. Make sure the labels on the
plot make sense.

12. Expand on challenge 11, but instead of just plotting the means, plot a line
indicating the standard deviation (sd). This style of plot is known as a forest
plot. Hint: Use `geom_errorbarh` for the line of upper and lower `sd`.
